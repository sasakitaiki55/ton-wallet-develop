# gram-wallet
gram-wallet.org is a free, client-side interface helping you interact with the TON blockchain.

## Security
gram-wallet follows the same path as official TON wallets: private keys do not leave your device, the keys are stored in the browser memory, encrypted with a password that is entered during transaction generation. Backend (which is already open-source) will be switchable soon.

## Gram wallet & Open-Source
Gram wallet will open source code before mainnet start.

## Issues and Proposals
Please post your Issues and Proposals as Issues in this repository.
